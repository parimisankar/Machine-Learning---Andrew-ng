# Machine-Learning by Andrew ng from Coursera
# By the time I finish this class, I'll know how to apply advanced machine learning algorithms to problems like
### anti-spam, 
### image recognition, 
### clustering, 
### building recommender systems, 
### and other problems. 
# I'll also know how to select the right algorithm for the right job, as well as become expert at 'debugging' and figuring out how to improve a learning algorithm's performance.
